A plugin to connect your Wview-enabled weather station to your Wordpress site with Widgets!


== Description ==

This plugin connects files generated by the WeeWX weather server software (or other software using the supported format and naming conventions) and displays the weather data in wordpress using widgets.

This plugin was originally developed for the wview weather server software and may still work with that software. However, as wview is no longer actively maintained, it will not be tested with this plugin.

Requirements:

1: Latest WeeWx weather server software (http://www.weewx.com)

2: Bravery, Patience and Forgiveness.  This software is pre-1.0.  It is being actively worked on.  

== Installation ==

1: Install the plugin in Wordpress.

2: Install the included phpparameter.htm.tmpl (found in the wxgrabber plugin directory) in the Standard Skin and add it in the skin.conf file under "[[ToDate]]" as 
[[[all]]]
template = phpparameterlist.htm.tmpl

2b: If you are not running weewx you can still use this plugin by having your weather software create a delimited text file similar to phpparameter.htx.  Name and value pairs can be omitted but names (before the semi-colon) MUST remain the same.

3: Setup the Weather Grabber plugin in the "Settings" area of Wordpress

4: Add and setup a Widget under Appearance

5: You're done!
